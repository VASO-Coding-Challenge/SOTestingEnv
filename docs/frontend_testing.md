# Testing Guide

The frontend tests use Jest to make sure components, buttons, and other features are working properly.

## What to test?

You can test any frontend feature as long as it is in the Jest functionality. We do not aim for 100% coverage as that would take too much time.

## How to Test?

### Step 1: Create test file

In `frontend/pages/__tests__` you will find the testing files. You can create more for each page. In these files, you can write Jest tests for the frontend.

### Step 2: Run the tests

Use `npm test` to run the tests. See `.github/workflows/frontend_test_nodejs.yml` for more information on how to set up the environment for GitHub.
