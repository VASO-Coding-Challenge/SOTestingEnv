Compelte the `find_value` function by writing a ***recursive*** function that finds the *i*th element of the following sequence.
Each element of this sequence is computed by adding up the three previous elements, and the first three elements of the sequence are 1, 2, and 3. 
Start counding from 0, so the zeroth element is 1.
